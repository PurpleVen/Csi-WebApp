  <li>The web app solves the problem of accessing multiple social platforms to know the activities, updates and event details by using an api that fetches images from instagram and displays it.</li><br>
  <li>The process of getting permission for event proposals approved are made easier as the hierarchical flow is maintained and updated</li><br>
  <li>The higher authorities are just a click away from knowing ideas initiated by <br> CSI as a complete description of the details are mentioned present in the form <br> of cards, charts and timeline.</li>

## Key Functionality
This project manages a task catalogue and offers “Efficient Scheduling” for CSI

## Ultimate goals:
The activities that the functional app will be able to perform include proposing events, assigning
tasks, maintaining drafts, summarising prior events, activity reports, and recording attendance.
