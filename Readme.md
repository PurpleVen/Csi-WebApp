   <ul>
  <li>The web app solves the problem of accessing multiple social platforms to know the activities, updates and event details by using an api that fetches images from instagram and displays it.</li><br>
  <li>The process of getting permission for event proposals approved are made easier as the hierarchical flow is maintained and updated</li><br>
  <li>The higher authorities are just a click away from knowing ideas initiated by <br> CSI as a complete description of the details are mentioned present in the form <br> of cards, charts and timeline.</li>

## The Need Of This Web-App
<ul>
  <li>Currently there is no platform for higher authorities to know about CSI's overall functioning.</li><br>
  <li>This would make the work of completing tasks more easier as we do not need to go through multiple platforms to access and store data, from submitting proposals to getting it reviewed, itâ€™ll be a hassle-free process.</li><br>
  <li>This will lead to less time investment as higher authorities are just a click away to know about the documentations and ideas of the team.</li>
</ul>

## Features 

| Feature | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| `InstaFeed` | An API which helps to display all the images from official Instagram page of CSI to our webapp |
| `Tables` | Dynamic and fetched from database (mysql) |
| `Approval & Rejection` | The event proposals fetched from the database can be accepted/rejected which gets reflected and stored in the db |
| `Feedback` | An Update can be given to the event proposals displayed |

## Project Exclusions:
